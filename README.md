# Masters_thesis
All source code used in my Master's Thesis.


Usage:
Install the dependancies using the environment.yml file.

Run reproduce_squidly.py to reproduce the main results of the thesis.


Requirements:
Unfortunately, a large GPU is needed in order for it to run... Usually something with 20GB+ Vram. Our code was reproduced on an NVIDIA h100 with 250GB of memory available.
I suggest reproducing with datasets 1 and 2 when unable to use more than 64GB of ram.
